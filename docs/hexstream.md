# Hexstream Documentation

Namespace:

Both of the hexstream classes are in a namespace named 'AraHaan'.

## Classes

> class hexstream

This class is the container of the ansii versions of this class. If you need wider characters use the whexstream class instead.

> class whexstream

This class is a container of the unicode version of this class. If you need large (wide) character support use this class only. Do not use the ansii one in this case if you care about the data getting turned to chinese or whatever as those are smaller sized characters.

## Functions

The following functions are avaible to both unicode and the ansii versions of this class.

*TODO: Finish this later.*
